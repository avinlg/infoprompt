## Can this be installed via apt?
No, this is not an apt package. `apt` is for system-wide packages managed by your Linux distribution. To distribute via `apt`, you would need to package it as a `.deb` file, host it in a repository, and follow Debian/Ubuntu packaging guidelines. For most users, the provided install script is the simplest and safest way.
