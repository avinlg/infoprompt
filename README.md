# infoprompt

A modern, informative, and colorful Bash prompt for developers. Shows git status, Python venv, time, user, host, working directory, and more‚Äîall with emoji and color.

## Features
- Git branch, status, and merge conflict detection
- Python virtual environment name
- Last command exit code (if nonzero)
- Time, user, host, working directory
- Colorful and emoji-rich, designed for dark terminals

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this directory:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url> ~/projects/bashprompt
   cd ~/projects/bashprompt
   ```
2. Run the installer:
   ```sh
   bash install-bash-prompt.sh
   ```
3. Open a new terminal or run:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_prompt
   ```

## Uninstall
```sh
bash uninstall-bash-prompt.sh
```

## Prompt status fields
The prompt shows concise git and workspace status fields. Their meanings:

- `ut:<n>` : number of untracked files (not added to git)
- `st:<n>` : number of staged (indexed) changes ready to commit
- `m:<n>`  : number of modified (tracked) files with unstaged changes
- `üü¢` / `üî¥`: repository clean or dirty (uncommitted changes)
- `‚öîÔ∏è MERGE CONFLICT`: shows when unmerged conflict markers exist

These are designed to be lightweight and computed with standard git commands so the prompt remains responsive.

## Troubleshooting
- If the prompt shows no git info, ensure `git` is installed and you're inside a git repository.
- If colors look wrong, make sure your terminal supports ANSI colors (most modern terminals do).

- Open issues or pull requests on GitHub: https://github.com/avinlg/infoprompt
- Please keep changes small and test in a local terminal.

## Can this be installed via apt?
No, this is not an apt package. `apt` is for system-wide packages managed by your Linux distribution. To distribute via `apt`, you would need to package it as a `.deb` file, host it in a repository, and follow Debian/Ubuntu packaging guidelines. For most users, the provided install script is the simplest and safest way.
